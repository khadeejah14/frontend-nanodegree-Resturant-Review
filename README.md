## Description
Project created as part of the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree.
## Project Instructions
All content is responsive and displays on a range of display sizes.Content should make use of available screen real estate and should display correctly at all screen sizes. An image's associated title and text renders next to the image in all viewport sizes.When available in the browser, the site uses a service worker to cache responses to requests for site assets. Visited pages are rendered when there is no network access.

## Run the Application

downlod  folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.

With your server running, visit the site: http://localhost:8000.
